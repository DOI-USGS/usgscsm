Messenger Dual Imaging System
=============================
The Messenger Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) is a suite of two framing
cameras-- a wide angle camera (WAC) and a narrow angle camera (NAC).  The wide
angle camera captures multispectral information, and the narrow angle camera
captures data in monochrome format. The combined cameras result in global mosaics
with an average spatial resolution of 200 meters per pixel.
